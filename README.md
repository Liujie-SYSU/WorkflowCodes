Please cite the paper when you use any of following codes except ctsta10.f90.

All the codes are suitable for the analyses of microstructures from micro-CT data or similar voxel-based 3D data; particularly suitable for processing large data as codes were written in Fortran and can be compiled in a supercomputer. Codes have been compiled by Intel Fortran and tested in Linux system. 

There may be some problems if it is compiled with other compilers; running in windows system cannot satisfy the requirement of RAM for large data.
